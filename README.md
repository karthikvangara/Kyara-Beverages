Kyara is a modern, single-page beverage brand website created as part of a web development internship. It features a stylish hero banner with logo animation, an about section, product teasers with animated cards, and a functional contact form that displays a thank-you message upon submission. The website is built using pure HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript for UI transitions, with responsive design elements and smooth animations.
